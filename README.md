# NATO-alphabet-helper

This project replicates the NATO phonetic alphabet communication system, where the user can input letters to be converted into the corresponding alphabet names, which is produced as the final output. 


Context:
The NATO phonetic alphabet was created by the International Civil Aviation Organization(ICAO) in the 1900s. It's still used for military and radio communcation around the world, keeping messages secretive between the user and recepient in the case of the message's interception.
